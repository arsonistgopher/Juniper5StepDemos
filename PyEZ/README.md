## PyEZ

You are required to have `PyEZ` installed and running, along with `JSNAPy`.

This code is rudimentary and should not be used in production. It has no error handling and is demo code only.

You are required to run the pre and post checks manually.

`jsnapy --snapcheck pre -f pre.yml`
`python buildnet.py`
`jsnapy --snapcheck post -f post.yml`
